## When2Slack

A Slack bot that that can help you do three things:

- Schedule meetings
- Create polls in Slack
- Remind people to react to messages

Kind of like when2meet but for Slack. Useful when deciding on meeting times.

### Usage

- `/schedule` creates a meeting poll, where members can vote on their availability
- `/poll` creates a poll where members can vote on a question

For reactions, you can comment:

`@<when2slack> :relaxed: :thumbsup: remind here`
`@<when2slack> :relaxed: :thumbsup: remind dm`
`@<when2slack> :relaxed: :thumbsup: list`
